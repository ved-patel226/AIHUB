The other day, we got some potentially devastating news that the U.S. was putting on new sanctions to the Chinese when it came to high-tech goods. Then, almost immediately, the Chinese fired back with what's being called a mineral ban, blocking the U.S. from getting key metals like gallium and germanium that we need for electric vehicle batteries, semiconductors. Holy cow, are things finally spinning out of control? I heard it all day nonstop that they are. But if so, how is it possible that the market just yawns, a Dow dipping 76 points, SMB inching up 0.05 percent, and then NASDAQ epicenter advancing 0.4 percent to a new record high? How can this be? How can the market be so wrong about this drastic trade war between the world's first and second largest economies? Or maybe, just maybe, does the market know something we don't? As we get closer to the change in Washington, I think we have to start thinking on a dual track toward our nemesis, the PRC. One track punitive, and the other track gloriously benign, at least if you own stocks. First, let's just point out that the sanctions announced by our government yesterday were unexpected, even if you misledly heard that they weren't. When I first heard about the scope of them, I gulped as my chapel just owns them.
